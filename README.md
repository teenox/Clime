## Goal

To create a simple weather App that makes use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to grab live data from the internet. With the app, you'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.

## Concepts to be learnt

* The use of the UITextField to get user input.
* Learn about the delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* The use of URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
* The use of Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
* The use of Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS
